# Labyrinthula_MPhys
This repository contains the customs scripts used in my Masters dissertation. It is titled 'The Morphology of Labyrinthula on Different Substrates'. This repository contains code to generate nematic Q tensors from vector information, as well as scripts to plot the nematic scalar order parameter as a function of vector pair distances.
