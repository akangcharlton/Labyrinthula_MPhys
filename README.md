# Labyrinthula_MPhys
This repository contains the customs scripts used in my Masters dissertation. It is titled 'The Morphology of Labyrinthula on Different Substrates'. The project used these scripts to mask out the unwanted data, overlay the vectors onto images and plot the correlation of the vectors against the distances between all the pairs of vectors. It has been continually modified for the specific requirements at the time and tailored to the names of files in my desktop. 

Abstract:
    "Seagrass wasting disease (SWD), caused by the protist Labyrinthula, has been linked to
major seagrass die-offs, but its relationship with SWD is poorly understood. This study
explores how substrate stiffness, modulated by agar concentrations, affects Labyrinthula
growth and morphology. Growth measurements confirm agar concentration influences
colony expansion, justifying microscopic analysis. Two image-processing techniques,
Watershed Binary and Vector Field Analysis, were trialed. The Vector Field method
revealed that lower agar concentrations increased colony correlation, which also grew
over time. However, a characteristic length scale could not be determined, as the
correlation decay did not follow a single functional form. Despite challenges with
biological variability and colony density, qualitative differences in colony morphology
across agar concentrations suggest substrate stiffness influences Labyrinthula growth.
This work provides a foundation for further research into the physical mechanisms behind
Labyrinthula colonies and their role in SWD."
